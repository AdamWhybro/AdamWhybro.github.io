<h3>Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</h3>
    <p>
        A have a positive bias towards mindfullness going into this section of the course. Over the past few years it has been of personal interest to me, leading me to read books, watch YouTube videos, 
        and engage with mindfullness apps. I strongly believe in mindfullness as a meta-tool for life, to improve self-awareness and EQ, hapiness, focus, mental clarity, and moment to moment peace.

    <h3>How did you find the overall experience? </h3>

        <p>Enjoyable. Mindfullness practices allow me to step out of day to day experience and reset. Mindfullness practice also usually will give me some indications of things I need to improve,
            fix, or actions I need to take to have peace. If I sit to meditate for 10 minutes usually the first 5 are spent ruminating on things I need to do, or problems I need to solve. I treat this 
            as a "to-do" list from my deeper intelligence.

<p> I am commited to spending 15 minutes in mindfullness mediation every morning before beginning my course work. This is a practice I already have in my life (although I am not always consistent). 
            My commitment therefore, is to make it an offical set intention. I will aim not to miss days.</p>

        <h3>Listening and Looping</h3>
        
        <p>My expereince of listening and looping was very postive. It felt good to have the space to share freely and openly while being heard. Speaking my thoughts aloud to another person gave me an opportunity
            to clarify how I was feeling and perception of my own experiences. Benjamin was a great listener and I really felt a postitive, supporting connection to my cohort classate. Although I have many supportive people in my life who I can speak with about the things I am going  through, having a designated time and space to really be open and focussed in my sharing was more profound and theraputic than what a standard conversation tends to be without the set intention.
            </p>
        
     <h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>

       <p> I enjoyed the expeirence of listening fully to Benjamin share about his week. I had a sense of empathy and compassion towards him as I could easily relate to the underlying feelings he was expressing. 
        A sense of connection and presence allowed me to feel less alone in my stresses and concerns with moving through foundations. I noticed how it felt good to be an open space for Benjamin to safely and freely voice his thoughts and emotions without fear of interuption or lack of interest. Many converstions unfortunately can feel like the other person is not truly listening and just waiting for an opportunity to chip back in with what is on their mind, so this intentional space of focus on the other person was a pleasant difference.
