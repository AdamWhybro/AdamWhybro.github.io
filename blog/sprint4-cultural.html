<p>
In my research and understanding of neuroplasticity, I have come to see that an individuals beliefs about their own ability to learn, grow, adapt, and confront 
challenges directly effects their ability to do such things. For this reason, in my own study, it seems that one of the best approaches I can take to this course 
is to constantly access and reflect on my attitude towards problem solving. When confronting a difficult task or problem, the appropriate mental model to adapt would ideally
be one that promotes confidence and excitiment at the opportunity to overcome, grow and learn. If I don't understand something, the mental shift would be from "I am 
failing at this task/problem" to "I just don't understand <em>yet</em> ". Running away from challenges does very little to stimulate brain activity and teaches a person 
to stay in a "fixed" mindset or space. Taking on a challenge head on stimulates high amounts of brain activity and promotes growth and adaption.
