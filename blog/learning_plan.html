    <h3>What is your long term goal and or career pathway?</h3>
    <p>
        Long term I would like to be a founder and owner of a successful tech start-up. I aim to be entrepreneurial and earn the freedom to not be told when or where to be somewhere, or what to wear. I hope that learning to program will give me leverage with the ideas I have that may add value to society. I like to build and create things. Starting with websites, and eventuating in companies.   
    </p> 
    <h3>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at EDA?</h3> 
    <p>
        I would like to develop the ability to inspire and motivate others to achieve a collective vision. This could be more broadly defined as communication, a strength I hope to further refine into powerful persuasion. Whether it be pitching to investors, negotiating salary, correspondence with team members on a project, or giving a presentation, I believe being able to articulate myself as clearly and concisely as possible will be an invaluable skill for my career.

        A description of your own strengths and limitations 
    </h3> 
    <P><u>Strengths</u></P> 
    <p>
<ul>
<li>As the results of my Gallop Strengths-Finder assessment has demonstrated, I am primarily fascinated by ideas. I am “able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena”. </li>
<li>My second highest scoring strength is “Relator”. I find “find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.” </li>
<li>Thirdly is Communication I “generally find it easy to put my thoughts into words. I am a good conversationalists and presenter.”</li>
<li>Fourthly, is “Input.” Due to this strength I “have a need to collect and archive. I accumulate information, ideas, artifacts and even relationships.”</li>
<li>Lastly, is Intellection. With this theme, I can be characterised by my intellectual activity. I am introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.

</li>

            <li>
                Tendency to think too much about myself
            </li>
            <li>
                Struggling to follow rules or orders

<h3>My commitment to how I will manage my workload in this programme</h3> 
<p>
    I am convinced that the number 1 factor that will determine my success in Dev Academy is sleep. When I am well rested, I can manage much larger workloads, focus for longer, am less distracted, more motivated, feel better, think more clearly, problem solve faster, absorb information more deeply, and comprehend a larger portion of what I am learning. 
</p> 
<p>
    On the flipside, when I a sleep deprived, my motivation, focus, and ability to work plummets. Consequently, the best thing I can do for my learning is to manage my sleep schedule and evenings. I need to prioritise wind-down time and reflections so that I don’t end up watching 3 more episodes of whatever Netflix is on and stay up late. When I do stick to my bedtime and wake time I have noticed that I have about 3 hours of my “prime-time” brain energy first thing in the morning. This is when I can get my best work done and when my mind is at it clearest and highest function. For example, if I wake up at 6:30am, the best thing I can do for the day is immediately get ready and begin coursework at 7pm working straight through until 10am. No doubt, I will need to put in another few hours on top of this each day, and generally as the day goes on my focus and output declines. 
</p> 
<h3>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
<p>
    If I become really stuck I have a few ways of attempting to solve the problem. Firstly, is clearly define what it is I need to do or understand. Once I have broken the issue down into a sentence I can then scan my mind for any obvious solutions I may have missed. If a lightbulb moment doesn’t occur at the stage, I can then move on to phrasing my problem in a way that is optimised for “Google.com”. Usually I can find someone with a similar problem who has had it resolved in forums, or there is a clear answer in an educational blog post somewhere. If all else fails, and I am feeling very stuck, I know I can ask my foundations facilitator Lache (who is very friendly and helpful!). I am also aware that one of my close friends is a snr developer and would be happy to sit down and have a chat to me about anything else that comes up. 
</p> 
<h3>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</h3> 
<p> 
    I expect the facilitation team to be warm and helpful, which to date they absolutely have been! 
</p> 
<h3>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whanau commitments such as school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in. </h3> 
<p>
    From Monday-Friday I run music lessons in the afternoons/evenings. This takes up a fair chunk of time during the week (3:30-7ish) and can also be tiring, meaning that doing more learning or course work after I finish is usually frustrating and unproductive. This is another reason why it is important that I do the majority of Dev Academy work first thing in the mornings from 7am-10am, and 11am-2pm.
