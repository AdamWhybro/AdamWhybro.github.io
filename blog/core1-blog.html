    <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
      <p>
        One of my core values is authenticity. I rank the importance of being true and authentic to myself as very high. I hate to feel like I am faking or impersonating in any way. I am constantly searching for my true self or identity, testing what I say against how it feels to say it. If I believe I am trying to impress, or parrot ideas I haven’t integrated through personal experience myself yet, I get a “cringe” sensation. Above all else, I want to be real, genuine, and honest. This can be difficult at times as I am aware of my failings and shortcomings and being honest and authentic about them to others is often uncomfortable and confronting. This value “paint’s me into a corner” as hiding away my undesirable qualities or lying about my mistakes only causes me to suffer further.

    <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make.</h3>
    <h3>Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>

<p>
    I work as a music tutor, teaching (mostly) children and teenagers how to play the Guitar, or the Piano. I have during my time doing this (self-employed) messed up my timetable, forgotten about rescheduled lessons, or had things come up preventing me from getting to a lesson on time. In these situations, the stress and embarrassment of my failings tempts me to lie to my student’s parents or stretch the truth to make myself look better. However, I have found throughout my younger life that this approach does more harm than good, and never ends well. So, despite it being difficult, I have decided that in situations such as these, I will call the parents of the student and be completely honest about my mistakes. Although embarrassing, the clients usually appreciate my honesty and humility and are happy to forgive and move on with a catch-up lesson or reschedule.

<h3>
    Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.
</h3>
<p>
    The culture I have grown up in can be split into layers. Firstly, is my immediate family, parents and siblings. My family’s values were primarily derived from Christianity, as my parents are both Christians. The values taught to me and installed from a young age could be summarised most fundamentally by the golden rule “do to others as you would have them do to you”. From this other core values such as a commitment to truth, love, compassion, and humility were stressed as essential to living a good life and being a good person. On a layer up from this, my friends and peers were from my youth group as a teenager and in high school. This wider group of friends also had similar values and we all encouraged and supported each other in upholding them. Finally, wider society (Auckland, New Zealand, Western Culture) also derives most of its laws and ideas of what a good person is from this European Judeo-Christian foundation. However, culture has shifted to a degree over the last 100 years, and these ideas are not as strong as they used to be. There is now a current of “follow your bliss, or “live for the moment” and more hedonistic, pleasure based ideas that have influenced me as a young adult. Drinking and drug culture, sexual culture, and self-promotion and personal gain are memes that also influence the world I am immersed in. Safe to say I have explored a number of approaches to life throughout my early adult years and am still forming my own conclusions.

    Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.
</h3>
<p>
<strong>Strengths</strong>
</p>
<p>
As the results of my Gallop Strengths-Finder assessment has demonstrated, I am primarily fascinated by ideas. I am “able to find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena”. 

My second highest scoring strength is “Relator”. I find “find deep satisfaction in working hard with friends to achieve a goal.” 

Thirdly is Communication I “generally find it easy to put my thoughts into words. I am a good conversationalists and presenter.”

Fourthly, is “Input.” Due to this strength I “have a need to collect and archive. I accumulate information, ideas, artifacts and even relationships.”

Lastly, is Intellection. With this theme, I can be characterised by my intellectual activity. I am introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.

    Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development
</h3> 
<p>
    My strengths of Ideation, Relator, Communication, Input, and Intellection all seem to be a favorable and synchronous combination that will aim me in learning, and interpersonal professional relationships. Relator and communication will be beneficial for working with teams, bosses, and anyone I may be responsible for training or managing further down my career path. Ideation, Input, and Intellection will be beneficial for absorbing information and applying it in effective and creative ways.
</p> 
<p>
    My limitations show that when I do not care for myself, I can become self-destructive and self-absorbed. I can ignore rules and regulations and instead get caught up in my own head, becoming withdrawn and idealistic.

<h3>
    Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.
</h3> 
<p>
    Input and intellection are the two most beneficial strengths I have for learning. Input allows me to enjoy collection of new data and the absorption of it. Intellection is useful as I enjoy thinking about and working with complex and technical ideas. It allows means that I have a tendency towards introspection, giving me a capacity for fast iterations of improvement in my approach towards problems that may arise.

    Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension.
</h3> 
<h3>
    Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why. 
</h3> 
<p>
    The example that comes to mind is working with my former band to try and write a new album. There was a variety of ideas being put forward as to the musical direction we should move forward in, and naturally a lot of passion involved. One member in particular when overruled through democracy became withdrawn and sulky. Refusing to engage and adopting a poor attitude at practices and writing sessions. The strategy used at the time was to not feed too much attention into this behavior or give it any energy. We tried to override his negative energy with our own positivity, moving forward with our goals regardless of his obvious tantrum. We then chose our most tactful member to have a private, open discussion with him about how he was feeling and how we could work together to all be happy with how we were progressing, emphasizing that it is a group endeavor and compromises were unavoidable. After a fair period of effort, with little improvement, it was decided that the only option left to us was to democratically ask that he leave the band as he was impeding our creative energy and unwilling to compromise. This was…effective.
