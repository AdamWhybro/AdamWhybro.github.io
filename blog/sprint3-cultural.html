      <h3>Emotional Intelligence </h3>
      

    <p>
      
      Emotional intelligence is made up of a number of components. Firstly, emotional intelligence refers to a person’s self-awareness and level of consciousness relating to their own inner state. To have a high level of EQ in this regard means to be connected to one’s own emotions and inner thought life. A person who is not developed in this regard will be highly reactive, mechanical, and unaware of how their own mental and emotional state is influencing their behaviors and interactions with others. Low self-awareness and consciousness will result in a person becoming “possessed” by a feeling that arises unconsciously, reacting to stimuli immediately without consideration. In contrast, a person who has high levels of self-aware consciousness will observe these responsive feeling arises, access them from a place of meta-awareness without judgement, and respond consciously with careful consideration, choosing their words and behavior from a place of calm thoughtfulness. 
      
      Stemming from this place of meta-awareness and high consciousness, an emotionally intelligent person will also be better equipped to read another person’s feelings and pick up on subtle nonverbal ques. They will have a more developed ability to access another’s emotional state, body language, motivations, and unspoken subtext. They will be more in tune with the energy, or “vibe” in a social setting, reading social ques and more nuanced indicators that suggest what an appropriate response may be. Emotionally intelligent persons are high in empathy and find it easy to connect with others and form social bonds. They are less neurotic, self-absorbed, and concerned with how they appear. Instead, they are able to be present with another person, listen intently, and respond from a place of non-judgmental awareness.

      <p>How is it different to IQ?</p>
      
      <p>IQ is a way of accessing a person’s fluid-intelligence and baseline cognitive ability. It gives no indication of a person’s ability to relate, communicate with interpersonal savvy, or empathise. As such, a person with high IQ but low EQ may be difficult to work with if they cannot use their intelligence in a social setting (e.g. a company or team project). </p>
      
      
      <hr>
    <p>Why is it important?</p>
      
    <p>Emotional intelligence is crucial to working in teams, or companies. The ability to read a room, interpret unspoken social ques, empathise with collogues, and communicate with members of a team is essential. Having skills and knowledge is of little use if it cannot be applied in the context of a team project, or even a free-lance engineer who needs to communicate and form trusting social bonds with their client. Interpersonal soft-skills are needed to win business, make sales, work effectively in teams, and present results back to seniors.</p>

    <h3>Mindfullness</h3>

<h3>Do you have any biases for or against mindfulness? If so, can you describe them?</h3>
    <p>
        A have a positive bias towards mindfullness going into this section of the course. Over the past few years it has been of personal interest to me, leading me to read books, watch YouTube videos, 
        and engage with mindfullness apps. I strongly believe in mindfullness as a meta-tool for life, to improve self-awareness and EQ, hapiness, focus, mental clarity, and moment to moment peace.

    <h3>How did you find the overall experience? </h3>

        <p>Enjoyable. Mindfullness practices allow me to step out of day to day experience and reset. Mindfullness practice also usually will give me some indications of things I need to improve,
            fix, or actions I need to take to have peace. If I sit to meditate for 10 minutes usually the first 5 are spent ruminating on things I need to do, or problems I need to solve. I treat this 
            as a "to-do" list from my deeper intelligence.

<p> I am commited to spending 15 minutes in mindfullness mediation every morning before beginning my course work. This is a practice I already have in my life (although I am not always consistent). 
            My commitment therefore, is to make it an offical set intention. I will aim not to miss days.</p>

        <h3>Listening and Looping</h3>
        
        <p>My expereince of listening and looping was very postive. It felt good to have the space to share freely and openly while being heard. Speaking my thoughts aloud to another person gave me an opportunity
            to clarify how I was feeling and perception of my own experiences. Benjamin was a great listener and I really felt a postitive, supporting connection to my cohort classate. Although I have many supportive people in my life who I can speak with about the things I am going  through, having a designated time and space to really be open and focussed in my sharing was more profound and theraputic than what a standard conversation tends to be without the set intention.
            </p>
        
     <h3>What was it like to fully listen?</h3>

       <p> I enjoyed the expeirence of listening fully to Benjamin share about his week. I had a sense of empathy and compassion towards him as I could easily relate to the underlying feelings he was expressing. 
        A sense of connection and presence allowed me to feel less alone in my stresses and concerns with moving through foundations. I noticed how it felt good to be an open space for Benjamin to safely and freely voice his thoughts and emotions without fear of interuption or lack of interest. Many converstions unfortunately can feel like the other person is not truly listening and just waiting for an opportunity to chip back in with what is on their mind, so this intentional space of focus on the other person was a pleasant difference.
