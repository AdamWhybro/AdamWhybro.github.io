    <h3>Command Line Primer</h3>
      <p>
        This morning I worked through the command line primer which taught me how to open the terminal and use it to navigate through locations and files on my Mac. There are a number of key commands that to me appear to be a basic vocabulary for efficiently using the terminal. 
        After watching a tutorial video on YouTube, and then reading a webpage on the same topic that displayed a list of these key commands, it is clear that it will be useful to memorise them. I will print a list and revise them regularly so that I do not need to constantly refer to a cheat sheet going forward through the course. 
    </p>

    <h3>In a couple of sentences, how would you describe the command line in plain English? Can you think of an analogy for it?</h3>

    <p>
      Specific instructions to complete specific actions on the computer. A driect way of managing files and carrying out...commands.
    </p>

<h3>Did you stick to the timebox guidelines? If not, what change would you make next time?</h3>

    <p>
      Some areas I completed quicker than the timebox, while others took much longer due to blocks, complications, and mistakes.
    </p>

    <h3>Name 5 commands you used, and what they do</h3> 
    <p>
      <ul>
      <li>cd - chnge directory</li>
      <li>mkdir - create folder</li>
      <li>git branch - view branches and see which I am on</li> 
      <li>cd .. - go up a layer</li> 
      <li>remote -v - view fetch and push locations for remote repo</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <h3>Whats the difference between git and GitHub?</h3>
<p>
  Git is used to edit and work on code/files locally via the terminal. GitHub is a powerful tool for team collaboration where branches can be made (or in the terminal) to edit code, submit these changes as pull requests for review, then merge back to the master branch where the project takes its final form. 
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe them?</h3>
<p>
  Local vs remote servers
</p>

<h3>What did you notice about your own learning? What did you do when you were confused or blocked?</h3>
<p>
  I focus best first thing in the morning. I need to manage distractions by keeping my phone put away unless needed urgently and only having study/work related apps and tabs open. My immediate response when coming up against a block or error is stress, panic and frustration. I should aim to relax and troubleshoot before asking for help. I also need to make sure I don’t procrastinate and leave coursework until the last minute.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Is there anything you'd do differently if you were to repeat the learning exploration again?</h3>
<p>
  Stay calm throughout! Study and work more hours during the day as I struggle to focus in the evenings.
Manage my time better. Spend more hours on coursework and prioritise tasks. Utilise google more and develop problem solving ability. Not procrastinate.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>What is Master?</h3>
<p>
  Master branch is the where the reviewed, working, collaborated version of a project is kept. It isn’t edited directly.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Why create a Branch?</h3>
<p>
  To safely make changes or additions to a projects code without the risk of bugging the master branch.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>How would you describe stage and commit to your non-tech-savvy friend?</h3>
<p>
  Staging is similar to a rough draft area to work on edits before committing (saving a version) them for others to see.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>What are some examples of when you would fork?</h3>
<p>
  It allows third party developers the ability to work on open source projects without the main code been threatened or the primary developer worrying about security.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Did you have any moments where it all clicked? What clicked?</h3>
<p>
  When I realised I knew all the terminal commands and git jargon needed for a task. I understood fundementally what I was trying to acheive and had the specific knowledge to carry it out.
</p> 
<hr>
<h3>Setup Repo & Create Blog</h3>
<p>
  This task I found fairly straight forward and I really enjoyed feeling competent. I feel like im starting to "get it".
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Reflect on this activity. When did you feel frustrated?</h3>
<p>
  I haven't had any frustrations so far with this specific task. The instructions are very clear and it follows on seemlessly from the previous challenge which is fresh on my mind.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>If you didn't already know that this is the way websites are made; was it what you pictured? How does the reality of this process differ from your preconceptions?</h3>
<p>
  I hadn't really considered all the proccesses that could be involved in web dev. Now that I am beginning to get the picture of workflow I can see why these tools and procedures exist. To me, it still seems quite complex and overwhelming at times - but I also appreciate that over a longer period of immersion and daily use, these elements will work together nicely to create a smooth and effective workflow.
</p> 
<hr>
<h3>What is your process so far for solving problems?</h3>
<p>Panic, cuss, then furiously google. If that fails, ask Lache for assistance. I can see how this process has room to improve. If I get really stuck I have tried to begin again. Re-think the problem, start with what I know, and expand slowly one step at a time. Realising where the mistakes are being made is critical. Then through trial and error, and testing a step to see if what I am doing is delivering the expected result, I can conclude if I am on the right track. Once I feel like I have progressed through a task to completion I will often enjoy doing it again from the start, this time understanding even more clearly and with greater speed what I need to do and how to do it.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>What was it like trying to summarise yourself to a group of strangers?</h3>
<p>
  It's something I've done many times in a variety of situations and am pretty comfortable with. That being said, it is always a bit strange to have a bunch of strangers listening to you talk about yourself.
</p>
<hr>
<h3>Could you feel your ego? Were you self conscious?</h3>
<p>At about 10 different points in sprint one, I genuinley considered that I may actually only be half as smart as I thought I was, and wondered if I was even capable of completing the course. It was a bit scary. I'm glad I now feel like I better understand what I was trying to do and the processes we have been learning.
