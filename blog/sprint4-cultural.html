<p>
In my research and understanding of neuroplasticity, I have come to see that an individuals beliefs about their own ability to learn, grow, adapt, and confront 
challenges directly effects their ability to do such things. For this reason, in my own study, it seems that one of the best approaches I can take to this course 
is to constantly access and reflect on my attitude towards problem solving. When confronting a difficult task or problem, the appropriate mental model to adapt would ideally
be one that promotes confidence and excitiment at the opportunity to overcome, grow and learn. If I don't understand something, the mental shift would be from "I am 
failing at this task/problem" to "I just don't understand <em>yet</em> ". Running away from challenges does very little to stimulate brain activity and teaches a person 
to stay in a "fixed" mindset or space. Taking on a challenge head on stimulates high amounts of brain activity and promotes growth and adaption.

<h3><div class=subtitle-font>Growth Mindset</div></h3>

<p><strong>Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</strong></p>

<p>
  The growth mindset is a mental model developed by Psychologist Carol Dweck that consists of an individuals beliefs about their ability to adapt and grow in the face of 
  challenges. This idea works in syncronicity with the scientific theory of Neuroplasticity - the two overlap and harmonise. A person with a growth mindset takes pride in 
  their efforts and journey towards success and excellence, whereas a person with an inverse mindset that is "fixed" holds the belief that their abilities are immutably 
  fixed without room for development. 
  <br>
  <br>
  This is relevant as it indicates that to succeed and progress though the Development Academy course, it would be optimal to challenge our own self beliefs 
  regarding such ideas. If I believe that I am incapable of overcoming problems or difficulties in learning the course material, this belief will no doubt manifest as a 
  form of self fullfilling prophecy. On the other hand, a positve, self reaffirming attitude that promotes the confrontation of challenges head on will result in a flexible, 
  adaptable mindset that finds a way to overcome.
</p>

<p><strong>In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</strong></p>

<P>
  During my research and exploration of this subject, I was surprised by how relatable many of the suggested ideas were to my own life, and the mindsets I 
  notice in a number of my music students. I reflected back to my second year of primary school when I had a fixed mindset that consequently found me putting my
  self worth in my ability to do well in tests, and academic games. Due to my belief that I was valued by my parents because of my intelligence and success in school, 
  I often lied to inflate my scores, or place of rank in math game leader boards. This trait of lying was reflected in a study by Carol Dweck where annonymous letters 
  were written by students asked to detail their experience of a test. 
  <br> 
</P>

<p>
 <em>
  "In the fixed mindset, imperfections are shameful — especially if you’re talented — so they lied them away. 
  What’s so alarming is that we took ordinary children and made them into liars, simply by telling them they were smart."
 </em>
</p>

<p><strong>How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</strong></p>

<p>
  I will apply mindfullness to self reflect on my internal attitudes and beleifs when feeling challenged. With my new and deepened understanding of fixed and growth mindsets 
  I will be concious to self affirm my capability to overcome challenges and grow because of them.
