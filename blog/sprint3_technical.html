<h3>What is an analogy to describe the differences between HTML and CSS</h3>

<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Every page on the internet uses HTML to store electronic data. This data contains the structure of the page, and its primary content.</li>
        <li>CSS is used for styling and beautifying this content. With CSS you can chage the font, colours, margins, and spacing between paragraphs or images.</li>

<h3>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life.</h3>
<img src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CPYEexud4bY/XbgOqC_PPdI/AAAAAAAADKg/i7XJ_xqEYFM_7Yw0eZq6dFhDaub1s0c-gCLcBGAsYHQ/s1600/java-control-flow-statement.png" alt="Loop Image">
<p>
The control flow is the order in which the computer executes statements in a script.
<br>
<br>
Code is executed in order from the first line in the file to the last line, unless the computer runs across the structures that change 
the control flow, such as conditionals and loops. 

An example might be some code that is used to gather user data from a fillout form on a website. 
The script submits validated data, but if the user makes an error that is detected or accidentally leaves a required field empty, the script prompts them to fill it in. 
To do this, the script uses a conditional structure or if...else, so that different code executes depending on whether the form is complete or not.

<h3>Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.</h3>
<P>
    The DOM (Document Object Model) is a browsers own internal programatic representation of the web page. This means that you can go into the DOM and manipulate 
    the browsers representation of the HTML document to change various elements (objects) on a webpage without changing the source HTML.
<br>
<br>

    An example of this might be changing the "h1" tag to a different text. This change is only be temporary and will be lost of the the page is refreshed 
    in the browser. You can also interact with the DOM via JavaScript, for example using the "document.getElementById(ID)" statement.

<h3>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h3>
<p>
    <h4>
        <div class=subtitle-font-2>Searching an Array for a Value</div>
      </h4>
     <p>An array is a set of ordered values, or collection of data that is represented by a container of square brackets "[]"
         <br>
     <p>
            When looking to find the position of a value within an array we can use the JavaScript console to search via 
            <strong>arr.indexOf().</strong>
            This calculates the position of a value within the array starting at 0.
     </p>
     <h4>
        <div class=subtitle-font-2>Accessing Object Data</div>
      </h4>
        <p>
            An object is simply a container for properties of JavaScript data. An object is represented within curly brackets " { } ". 
            Data that is listed in these brackets are properties that are given values. An example for an object may be "Car". 
            A cars object values may be:
            <br>
            <ul> 
                <li>car.name = Prius</li>
                <li>car.weight = 1000kg</li>
                <li>car.colour = Blue</li>
            </ul>
            <P>You can access an objects properites with either of the following two syntax</P>
            <ol>
                <li>objectName.propertyName</li>
                <li>objectName["propertyName"]</li>
            </ol>
        </p>

<h3>Explain what functions are and why they are useful.</h3> 
<p>
    <strong>Definition:</strong>
    <br>
<ul>
   <li>A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.</li> 
    <li>A JavaScript function is executed when "something" invokes it (calls it).</li>
</ul>
