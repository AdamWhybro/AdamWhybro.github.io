    <h3>Can you describe the steps you did in this exercise in simple terms?</h3>
      <p>
        I created a dirdctory/folder for my blog and put a html and css file inside it, then linked them in VS code by editing a line of code. I pushed these files into the relevant repo on Github so that the blog can be hosted there and be live for viewing. This will be the template for my blog website going forward.

    <h3>How are you finding working with the timeboxes?</h3>
<p>
Timeboxes are a great way to manage expectations and plan coursework sessions. In conjunction with toggl, timeboxs help to stay on tast and work to appropriate depths of understnading without skimming or going too deep.

<h3>What obstacles did you come up against? How did you overcome them?</h3>
<p>
Throughout the construction of my website I came up against a number of obsticles. Firstly, learning the syntax and format of basic HTML and CSS code. To overcome this, I primarily googled examples and experimented with recreating them in VS code, follow by opening the index.html file to see how it worked. I also struggled initially with linking the main.css file to my additional pages on the site. Again, google was my friend and after some frustration realised that I needed to insert a "/" after the ".." to direct out of the blog folder and into the working directory. YouTube and Google were the primary resources I used to investigate small blocks as they arose (many times).

<h3>What are of you proud of from this challenge?</h3>
<p>
I am proud of my ability to problem solve and overcome numerous blocks that were constatly coming up as I worked through the task of building my first ever website. Althogh it isn't the prettiest, I am proud of how it has turned out, and how I picked up the fundemental building blocks of website construction. I now feel like I have a good understanding of the way HTML and CSS ineract with each other to form the structure and style of websites.

<h3>Write a small story about HTML and CSS and their relationship. You could personify elements or speak from your own personal experience. The story should capture insight about the nature of HTML and CSS.</h3>
<p>
HTML as I understand it is the primary content or structure of a website. It is the framework, the content, the empty house. CSS is the stylistic component that makes it look appealing. This could be viewed as the decorations, wallpaper, colors, art, and personalisation of the site.

<h3>Any moments of surprise or joy?</h3>
<p>
It was a surprising joy when I first linked my CSS file in the head section of the index.html file and refreshed my browser. Seeing the site come to life with color, margins, fonts, and div blocks was very exciting. I wasn't entirely sure if it was going to work, so when it did I was relived, proud, excited, and encouraged.

<h3>If HTML and CSS were animals, which animals do you think they would be? Why?</h3>
<p>
If HTML were an animal it would be a beaver. Beavers are hard working builders and like to create structures with the tools available. CSS would be a peacock that flaunts its beauty for the world to see. This is becasue CSS is the style component while HTML is the structure and content.
